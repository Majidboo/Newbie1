      <p id="p">My Dearest Love,

There are so many things I want to say, but they all come back to this: I love you—deeply, truly, and without end.

Since you came into my life, everything feels brighter. You’ve shown me what it means to be seen, to be understood, and to be loved with a kind of warmth I never knew I needed so much. You make my days lighter, my heart fuller, and my world better just by being in it.

Even in silence, even across distance, I feel connected to you. You are my peace and my passion, gf/bf and my heart’s home. I want to stand beside you through every season, every high and low, loving you more with each passing day.

Always yours, </p>
